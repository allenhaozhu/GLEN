# GLEN (Generalized Laplacian Eigenmaps in NeurIPS 2022)
In this repo, we give the core code about the proposed method in our NeurIPS. Please note that the parameter eps is dependent on the specific data set. I will provide another version based on the trace normalization in "Learning Diverse and Discriminative Representations via the Principle of Maximal Coding Rate Reduction,NeurIPS 2021"
